Privacy Policy for ContentCreator
Effective date: 15 February 2026
1) About this app
ContentCreator is an automation tool used to publish content to the Facebook Page The Bulletproof Mind via the Facebook/Meta API. The posts may include:
Dhamma quotes and short teachings


Dhamma discussions / questions for community discussion


Links to YouTube videos (Dhamma talks, guided sessions, teachings)


Links to other platforms (e.g., website posts, podcasts, Telegram/WhatsApp channel links, etc.)


Event announcements and sharing (e.g., meditation programs, talks, online/offline events)


2) Data we collect
We do not collect, store, or sell personal data from Facebook users or visitors.
To function, the app may access only the minimum necessary technical credentials:
Facebook Page Access Token (or system token) used to publish posts to the Page


Basic technical logs (optional) such as time of posting, success/failure status, and error messages for troubleshooting


The app does not read private messages, view personal profiles, or access personal friend data.
3) How we use information
We use the Page token and related permissions only to:
Publish and schedule posts to The Bulletproof Mind


Maintain reliability (e.g., detect posting errors)


4) Content and links
Posts created by this app may contain text, images, or links related to Dhamma content (quotes, teachings, discussions), and may link to:
YouTube videos


Your website


Other public platforms where your content is hosted


When a user clicks a link, they are subject to that external platform’s post (e.g., YouTube/Google, dahama.com, etc.).
5) Data sharing
We do not share any collected data with third parties.
No personal data is sold, rented, or traded.


6) Data retention
Page tokens (if stored) are kept only as long as needed for posting automation and are removed/replaced when revoked or rotated.


Any optional technical logs are retained for 30 days for debugging and service reliability, then deleted.


7) Security
We take reasonable steps to protect tokens and any technical logs, including restricted access and secure storage where applicable. However, no method of storage or transmission is 100% secure.
8) Your choices and rights
Because we do not collect personal user data, there is typically nothing to access, correct, or delete.
 If you have questions, you may contact us using the details below.
